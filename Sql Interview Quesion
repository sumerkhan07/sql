what is dbms?
A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software system designed to create, manage,
and retrieve data efficiently in a structured format. It enables users to store, organize,
and manipulate data securely while maintaining data integrity, reducing redundancy, 
and supporting concurrent access for multiple users.

What is RDBMS?
A Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is a type of database management system 
(DBMS) that stores data in a structured format using tables composed of rows and columns. 
It organizes data based on the relational model, where data in different tables can be
related to each other through keys like primary keys and foreign keys. 
RDBMS software enables users to create, update, manage, and query these relational databases, 
often using SQL (Structured Query Language).
Key features of an RDBMS include data integrity, security, consistency, and support for concurrent 
multi-user access. Popular examples of RDBMS include MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server. 
The relational model offers flexibility, scalability, and an intuitive way to handle data and its relationships, 
making RDBMS the foundation of most modern database systems.
